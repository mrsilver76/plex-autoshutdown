*A simple script which will check that no-one is using Plex before shutting down the server it is running on.*

This script is useful for people who have no requirement to run their Plex server 24/7 and have periods of time where no-one is using their server (eg. the early hours of the morning).

**There are two scripts, one for Windows uses and one for Linux users.** The Linux one may work with macOS, but I have no way of verifying. I'm happy to take a submission/fix from someone who owns one. 

## 🧰 Features

Despite being small, these scripts have some useful features:

* 🖥️ Works on Windows and Linux (and possibly macOS)
* ⚙️ Easy to set up, there is (literally) only one option that you must configure.
* 🎬 Will not shut down a machine if there are active Plex streams (audio or video).
* 📥 Will not shut down a machine if there are active Plex downloads.
* 📺 Will not shut down a machine if live TV is being watched or recorded.
* ⏳ Will not force a machine to shut down for a (configurable) period of time after power up.

## 📦 Download

1. Get the latest version from https://github.com/mrsilver76/plex-autoshutdown/releases. Windows users should download the zip file, Linux users should download the tar.gz file.
3. Decompress the file. On Windows, you can double-click the file. On Linux you should use the `gunzip` command.
4. Use the file ending in `.bat` for Windows and the file ending `.sh` for Linux.

## ⚙️ Configuration

To configure the script, open it up in your preferred text editor. For Windows, Notepad will do. For Linux, I recommend [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) which usually comes preinstalled with most distributions.

There are two things in the code you can easily change. You must change the `PLEX_TOKEN` setting, the other one is optional:

- **`PLEX_TOKEN`**  
  The script uses the Plex API in order to determine whether or not anything is streaming. To do this, it needs a token to use for authentication. Plex provides instructions on how to find the token for your Plex server [here](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/). 

  You should modify this line to include your token (capitalisation is important). If you provide an invalid token then the script will always report that something is streaming. The token in the code (`abcd1234efgh5678`) is invalid and will not work.

> [!CAUTION]
> You should never share your Plex token with anyone else.

- **`MIN_UPTIME`**  
  This is the minimum amount of time (in seconds) that a server must have been running (the “uptime”) before the script will work. The default (and recommended) value is `7200` which equates to 2 hours.

  Using `7200` as an example, if you turn back on your Plex server at (say) 1am, then it will not attempt to turn the server back off again until 3am, even if you stop using it at 1:30am.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you set this value too low, then your server may turn off very quickly after you have turned it back on.

## ▶️ Running the script

To run the script, you can either double-click on it or run it from the command line. If you are using Linux then you will probably need to make the script executable with `chmod +x plex-autoshutdown.sh`.

To run on your Plex server, you will need to set up the script to run multiple times over the night. This is to ensure that if the shutdown is blocked because something is being streamed, then it will try again at a later time.

## 🪟 Installation (Windows)

These instructions assume that you want to turn your server off from between midnight and 6am and that you will check the server status every 15 minutes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you check the server status too frequently then there is a higher chance that the server will power off whilst you are picking something else to play.

You need to set up a scheduled task to run the script:

- Click on “Start”, type “Task” and select “Task Scheduler”.
- Click on “Create Task”.
- Set the Name to: “Plex Autoshutdown”.
- Set the Description to: “Automatically shut down this machine if Plex is not running”.
- If you run Plex without logging a user in, then you will need to enable “Run whether user is logged in or not”.
- Click on the “Trigger” tab.
- Click on “New”.
- Set Begin the Task to: On a schedule.
- Set Settings to Daily, Start at 00:00, Recur every 1 day.
- Click on “OK”.
- Set “Repeat Task” to “every 15 minutes” for a duration of “6 hours” (you’ll need to type this in as the drop-down won’t have it)
- Set “Enabled” to ticked.
- Click on “Actions”.
- Click on “New”.
- Set “Action” to “Start a program”.
- Set Program/Script to the name and location of the script. Use the “Browse” button to locate it.
- Click on “OK”.
- Click on “Conditions”.
- Ensure that “Wake the computer to run this task” is turned off.
- Click on “OK”.

## 🐧 Installation (Linux)

These instructions assume that you want to turn your server off from between midnight and 5:45am and that you will check the server status every 15 minutes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you check the server status too frequently then there is a higher chance that the server will power off whilst you are picking something else to play.

You need to set up a cron to run this task:

- Type `crontab -e`
- Add the following line to the bottom of the crontab file: `0,15,30,45 0-5 * * * /path/to/plex-autoshutdown.sh >/dev/null`
- Make sure you change `/path/to/plex-autoshutdown.sh` to the correct full path and location.
- Save the file.

As the script outputs messages, this will be emailed to you. The use of `>/dev/null` ensures that this does not happen but you can also redirect it to a file if you wish.

## 🔌 Automatic power on

Most modern computer BIOS’ allow you to configure a computer to power on at a specific time. You will need to Google the brand of your computer/motherboard to find out how to access the BIOS. If it usually through pressing one of the F keys on power up.

> [!TIP]
> Whilst you are configuring this, I recommend you also enable the “automatically power on after power loss” option. This means that if you have a power cut then the server will automatically boot again when power is restored.

## ⚠️ Known issues

- The Plex API will often incorrectly report that content is being streamed for several minutes after it has been stopped. There is no workaround for this.
- There is no validation of the Plex token. If you've supplied one that doesn't work then the script will incorrectly report that something is being streamed and your server will never shut down.

## 💡 Future development: open but unplanned

This script currently meets the needs it was designed for, and no major new features are planned at this time. However, the project remains open to community suggestions and improvements. If you have ideas or see ways to enhance the tool, please feel free to submit a [feature request](https://github.com/mrsilver76/plex-autoshutdown/issues).

Some possible improvements I've considered, but won't implement unless there is demand, are:

- **Report number of streams rather than just checking for 0.** Instead of only detecting whether there are zero streams, report how many active streams are running so you can decide based on count thresholds. 
- **Output to logs instead of screen.** Add or improve logging so that script output goes to log files rather than just the console, useful for monitoring and debugging. 
- **Check Plex token prior to checking for streams.** Validate the authentication token for Plex Media Server before attempting to check for active streams, to handle auth failures gracefully. 
- **Sleep option, instead of power down.** Provide an option to put the machine into sleep/standby rather than fully powering it down when no active streams are detected. 
- **Test command line option.** Add a “dry-run” or “test” command line flag that will simulate the shutdown check without executing the shutdown, for validation purposes.
